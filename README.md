# RenderGAN

This repository holds the code to the ["RenderGAN: Generating Realistic Labeled Data"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01331)
paper.

You might be interested in:

* implementation of the [RenderGAN](https://github.com/berleon/deepdecoder/blob/master/deepdecoder/render_gan.py#L130)
* code of the [generator network](https://github.com/berleon/deepdecoder/blob/master/deepdecoder/render_gan.py#L168)
* [discriminator](https://github.com/berleon/deepdecoder/blob/master/deepdecoder/networks.py#L480)
* architecture of the [decoder network](https://github.com/berleon/deepdecoder/blob/master/deepdecoder/networks.py#L588)
* the [Makefile](https://github.com/berleon/deepdecoder/blob/master/deepdecoder/scripts/Makefile) to orchestrate the training process
* the [hyperparameters](https://github.com/berleon/deepdecoder/tree/master/config/train) for the training 

We do not provide any information how to run our code. If you are interessted, fill
an issue and let us know. This could motivate us enough to document the installation process and
to upload the unlabeled training data and the real test data.
